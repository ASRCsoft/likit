# Skykit
Python package with utilities for Lidar and other weather profile instruments


# Usage
Skykit currently requires the Python packages `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `statsmodels`, and will likely require `netCDF4` in the near future. To use the package, put the folder in your working directory and run
