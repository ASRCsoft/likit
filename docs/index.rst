raspPy: Atmospheric Profile Time Series in Python
==========================================

raspPy is a package that extends `xarray
<http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html>`_ with utilities for
working with atmospheric profile time series data, with code
specifically for lidar and microwave radiometer data.

The package includes two sets of code:

1. Functions to convert data into xarray objects, and
2. xarray modules that simplify common tasks

..
   To take full advantage of raspPy users should refer to the xarray documentation.
