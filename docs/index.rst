wxprofilers: Weather profiler instruments in Python
===================================================

``wxprofilers`` provides tools for working with weather profiler
instruments such as wind lidars, microwave radiometers, and
radiosondes in Python. It converts data files into `xarray
<http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html>`_ objects, and can
derive or estimate weather variables such as wind speeds, PBL height,
and CAPE.
