wxprofilers: Weather profiler instruments in Python
===================================================

``wxprofilers`` provides tools for working with weather profiler
instruments such as wind lidars, microwave radiometers, and
radiosondes in Python. It provides functions for converting data files
into `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html>`_ and
`pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ objects, and functions for
deriving weather variables such as wind speeds, PBL height, and cape.
